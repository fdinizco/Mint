## Overview

### Libraries

I used many, a few of then are there wating for a future implementation of the project! 

The Most important were: 

FFImageLoading => https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading

Prism => https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism

Refit => https://github.com/reactiveui/refit

### Application Architecture

MVVM + Behaviors + Async 

### How to compile: 

1st: Clone the Repo 

2nd: For each Solution in the project Restore Nugget Packages

3rd: Go UpMovies -> Resources -> Languages -> AppResources.resx -> At the end of the file, please add one Space (This is required the first time to be sure that Compiled file is created) 

Last: Run it! 

### Pending things (No enough time):

* Make a Launcher Screen to the App

* Make offline load json

* Put All strings inside AppResources.resx

* Hide List while there is no items ( I would do it with a custom header) 

* Implement the list filter while using the SearchBar (The logic was there, just no time to do it) 

* Change App Icon
